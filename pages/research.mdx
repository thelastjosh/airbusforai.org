### Airbus for AI: A Global Strategy for Public Value Creation
**Authors:** Joshua Tan, Brandon Jackson, Robin Berjon, Diane Coyle
This brief argues that the concentration of frontier-model capabilities in a handful of U.S. and Chinese firms has created a structural sovereignty gap for the rest of the world, and recommends a multilateral “Airbus for AI” capable of co-developing public, shared model infrastructure; drawing on lessons from aerospace industrial policy, it outlines a distributed training pipeline, shared governance, and public-purpose alignment layers that allow countries to participate upstream in model design rather than remain dependent on foreign commercial platforms.

### Towards a Singapore AI-lines
**Author:** Joseph Low
This working paper proposes a “Singapore AI-lines” strategy, arguing that Singapore cannot match frontier compute scale but can meaningfully influence global model development by providing Southeast Asian alignment layers, governance infrastructure, and modular contributions to a shared foundational-model consortium; using aviation analogies, it distinguishes between operating downstream AI services and helping shape upstream model infrastructure, making the case that small states require multilateral arrangements—such as an Airbus for AI—to maintain long-term sovereignty and relevance.

### Middle Power AI Index
**Authors:** Jacob Taylor
The Middle Power AI Index benchmarks the capabilities of public and private AI labs in countries that fall between superpowers and low-capacity states, quantifying national compute, institutional strength, talent pipelines, model-development maturity, and safety infrastructure; by showing the widening gap between frontier labs and everyone else, the Index demonstrates why middle powers cannot sustain sovereign AI development alone and instead require shared industrial structures—providing empirical grounding for the Airbus for AI model.

### The 1960s Aerospace Industry
**Authors**: Joshua Tan
This appendix draws parallels between the 1960s aerospace industry — dominated by a North Atlantic duopoly (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas) — and the contemporary frontier-AI industry, illustrating how high fixed costs, vertically-integrated supply chains, natural-monopoly dynamics, and dual-use strategic importance forced middle powers into multilateral industrial coalitions; by detailing historical dimensions such as scale, market concentration, barrier to entry, business-model differences, and geopolitical structure, the appendix grounds the case that a similar “Airbus for AI” consortium may be the only viable path for non–U.S./China states to compete.  ￼

### Appendix: AI as a Public Utility
**Authors**: Joshua Tan; Brandon Jackson; Diane Coyle
This appendix argues that frontier foundation models possess the hallmarks of a natural monopoly — enormous sunk training-cost investments, near-zero marginal cost of inference, strong economy-of-scale effects — and therefore could be governed as a public utility, proposing regulatory analogues (regulated asset base, universal service obligation, independent regulator, public-data dividend) and business- model options (state-owned, private regulated monopoly, public-private franchise) to align incentives toward safe, transparent, and societally beneficial model infrastructure rather than narrow rent capture.  ￼

### Appendix: Why Sovereignty?
**Authors**: Robin Berjon
In this appendix, the authors make the sovereignty argument: that many middle powers are structurally disadvantaged in frontier-AI development, facing substantial dependence on foreign platforms, risk of foreign acquisition of national labs, and fragmentation of national initiatives; the text explores how import-dependence, limited markets, talent and compute bottlenecks undermine sovereignty, and then frames a multinational public-model consortium as a sovereignty-preserving alternative.  ￼

### Public AI White Paper  
**Authors:** Public AI Network
This white paper sets out the architectural blueprint for a “Public AI Stack,” arguing that societies need publicly governed, transparent, and interoperable model infrastructure rather than relying entirely on private AI platforms; it defines core components—including inference utilities, public evaluation regimes, identity and compliance rails, and cooperative model-training layers—and shows how these elements can be federated across jurisdictions, thereby providing the technical and institutional foundations on which an Airbus for AI consortium could successfully operate.
