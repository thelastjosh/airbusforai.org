# Airbus for AI
Joshua Tan, Jacob Taylor, Robin Berjon, and Diane Coyle.

Airbus for AI is a blueprint for a new frontier AI lab designed to compete directly with OpenAI.

This site organizes arguments, resources, and people to create such an Airbus for AI.

## An Airbus for AI
Inspired by Airbus, we propose that Canada, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, France, the U.K., and other middle powers unify **their existing sovereign AI efforts** into a **Public AI Company**—a competitive frontier AI lab to build and commercialize AI in the public interest.

### How?
First, each participating nation needs to identify or organize at least one **_national entity_** which will participate in the Public AI Company. Each national entity should have top-level political support and frontier AI capabilities in at least one component of the AI stack. Depending on the country and its sovereign AI strategy, this entity may be an existing private national champion (e.g. France's Mistral, Canada's Cohere), a public national lab (e.g. Spain's BSC, Japan's RIKEN), an existing regional coalition (e.g. New Nordics AI), or a new public-private partnership.

Second, integrate these national entities into an **_Airbus-style enterprise_** that coordinates key shared activities:
1. model building, especially pre-training,
2. resource sharing, especially compute and expertise, and
3. market strategy, including shared branding.

Third, each national entity should handle localization for language, culture, and in-country data, deployment in local data centers for inference, and public engagement with citizens and political leadership. Depending on the local commercial and political environment, each national entity may consider adopting a **_public utility_** business model (see Appendix: AI as a Public Utility).
